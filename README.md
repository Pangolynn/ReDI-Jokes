ReDI Jokes is a mini App for ReDi Digital School of Integration. 
It showcases a React + Vite TypeScript app that uses a custom hook to fetch jokes from an API and displays them.
You can fetch news ones, save them to a library(state)
and navigate between Jokes and the Library.
The punchline can be hidden/shown based on state.
